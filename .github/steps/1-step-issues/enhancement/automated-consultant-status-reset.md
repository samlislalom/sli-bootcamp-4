# Automated Consultant Status Reset

## Problem
Consultants remain marked as "on project" even after their project ends, leading to inaccurate availability tracking.

## Proposed Solution
Implement an automated process that resets consultant status to "Available" when their assigned project is completed. This could be a scheduled job or batch process.

## Benefits
- Accurate consultant availability
- Improved project staffing
- Reduced manual updates
